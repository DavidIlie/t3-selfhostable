# uploads - problems

uploadthing is super cool i just dont like i am using their servers

here i would neeed to define the uploadthing router thing so that i can use it in both expo and nextjs

- i want to build a custom uploadthing server which can satisfy the requests the lib does and then make use of the UPLOADTHING_SERVER_URL or something like that env variable or create my own fork of the project

> This is because in reality most devs use the cloud (S3) but i do not like the cloud and in my server I am running my own S3 instance and I want to be able to use that to keep everything in house
